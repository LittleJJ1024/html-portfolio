<h1>The Best Movies According to Vedang</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sholay</h3>
<p>(A Hindi movie) This is a classic movie from the '70s which I love, partly due to the amazing acting in it. I could watch it several more times and not get bored of it.</p>
<h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>One of the best English movies of all time in my opinion. It has a great story, and, being a musical, features many amazing songs.</p>
<h3>Anand</h3>
<p>(Another Hindi movie) I like this movie because it teaches an important life lesson: to always stay joyful no matter the circumstances</p>
